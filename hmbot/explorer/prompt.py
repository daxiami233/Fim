You need to determine whether the page transition is correct.
I will give you three images: the first is the page before event execution (before), the second is the expected page after PTG event execution (after), and the third is the page obtained after actual event execution (actual after).

**Verification Priority:**
1. **First determine if the operation is effective**: Compare the first image (before) and the third image (actual after). If there is no change in the interface, it means the operation did not take effect, return no_change
2. **Then determine if the transition is correct**: If the operation has taken effect, compare the second image (PTG after) and the third image (actual after) to determine whether it has transitioned to the correct interface

**Judgment Criteria:**
- **Operation effectiveness judgment**: Whether the overall layout and structure of the interface have changed
- **Interface matching judgment**: Only focus on whether the interface structure is the same, whether it is the same interface in the software
- No need to consider whether the content is completely the same, text, numbers, time, images and other specific content can be different
- As long as it is the same functional interface in the software (such as: the same settings page, the same list page, the same detail page, etc.), it is considered a match

Please return the results strictly in the following JSON format:

{
  "think": "Brief analysis: first determine if the operation is effective (1vs3), then determine if the interface matches (2vs3)",
  "result": true/false,
  "error_type": "no_change/wrong_page/null"
}

Where:
- think: Brief analysis process, analyzed according to verification priority
- result: Boolean value, true means the operation is effective and transitions to the correct interface, false means there is a problem
- error_type: Error category, fill in when result is false:
  - "no_change": The operation did not take effect (the first and third images are basically the same)
  - "wrong_page": The operation took effect but transitioned to the wrong interface (the first and third images are different, but the second and third images do not match)
  - "null": Fill in null when result is true

Please ensure that the returned result is in valid JSON format."""

I need you to analyze screenshots before and after operations and generate corresponding operation descriptions with page transition information.

I will give you two images:
First image: Interface screenshot before operation (before)
Second image: Interface screenshot after operation (after)

Please analyze the differences between these two screenshots, infer what operations might have been performed from the first screenshot to the second screenshot, and generate specific operation descriptions along with page transition information.

When analyzing, please consider:
- Interface layout changes (page transitions, popup appearance/disappearance, etc.)
- Element state changes (button highlighting, text changes, switch states, etc.)
- Content changes (list item increase/decrease, input box content, etc.)
- Scroll position changes
- Focus or selection state changes

Please provide your analysis in the following format in Chinese:

**界面转换描述：**
从[源界面简要描述]转换到[目标界面简要描述]

**操作描述：**
- 点击[具体位置]的[具体元素]
- 向[方向]滑动
- 输入文本"[具体内容]"
- 长按[具体元素]

**Notes:**
- Do not click buttons with voice input functionality (such as microphone icons, voice buttons, etc.)
- Prioritize text buttons or icon buttons for operations
- Be specific about what type of pages/interfaces are shown in before and after screenshots
- Describe the page transition in a clear and concise manner

Please provide concise and clear descriptions in Chinese."""

Two images:
  - Target page (the page we want to return to, which is the page before the action is executed). **Important: The red boxes in the target page mark the locations that were clicked to transition from the target page to the current page.**
  - Current page (the page where the phone is now, the page after the action is executed, need to return to the target page from here)

## Action Space
Your **only** available actions are:
- `click(point='<point>x y</point>')`: Clicks a specific coordinate on the screen.
- `type(content='...')`: Types the given content. To submit after typing, append "\n".
- `scroll(point='<point>x y</point>', direction='down' or 'up' or 'right' or 'left')`: Scrolls the page from a starting point in a given direction.
- `press_back()`: Simulates pressing the back button.
- `finished(content='xxx')`: Use this ONLY when the task is fully complete. Use escape characters (\\', \\", \\n) for the content.

## Output Format
