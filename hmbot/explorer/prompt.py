page_info_prompt = f'''You are an expert proficient in UI analysis. I will upload a screenshot of an Android App interface. Please analyze this image strictly according to the following rules:

1.  **Brief Interface Description**: Provide a brief description of the entire page, including its main function, overall layout structure, and the app type or functional module it belongs to.
2.  **Control Recognition**: Identify all user-clickable controls in the image, such as buttons, icons, input fields, and entire rows of list items.
3.  **Functionality Abstraction**: Based on the interface's content, abstract and list the core functions this page offers **in the context of the entire application**.
      * **Focus on the Page's Unique Purpose**: The functions should represent the primary user goals and tasks specific to this screen (e.g., 'Book a flight', 'Publish a post', 'Adjust privacy settings').
      * **Exclude Generic Navigational Actions**: **Do not include** common navigational actions like 'Go back', 'Open menu', or 'Close page'. These describe movement between pages, not the function *of* the page itself.
4.  **Ignore the Top Bar**: Completely ignore the system status bar at the very top of the device screen (i.e., the part that displays the time, signal, and battery).
5.  **Ignore the Bottom Navigation Bar**: Completely ignore the system navigation bar at the very bottom of the screen (i.e., the bar containing the Back, Home, and Recent Apps buttons).
6.  **Consolidate Information**: For a single, clickable list item, you must consolidate all textual information within it (such as title, summary, price, date, etc.) into a single description. Do not split them into multiple entries. For standalone controls that are not list items, such as individual buttons, icons, or input fields, describe them based on their own function without consolidating them with other information.

Please return the result strictly in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "page_description": "A description of the entire page, including unique features to distinguish it from other interfaces.",
  "page_functions": [
    "A page-specific function within the app.",
    "Another page-specific function."
  ],
  "clickable_elements": [
    "A complete, consolidated description of the control."
  ]
}
```

**Example:**

```json
{
  "page_description": "This is a product detail page of an e-commerce application. The top of the page has a back button and a share button, the middle displays the product image and detailed information, and the bottom has 'Add to Cart' and 'Buy Now' buttons.",
  "page_functions": [
    "View product images and details",
    "Share product information",
    "Add product to shopping cart",
    "Purchase product directly"
  ],
  "clickable_elements": [
    "Back arrow button on the top left of the page",
    "Share icon on the top right of the page",
    "The main product image in the middle of the page",
    "Blue 'Add to Cart' button at the bottom of the page",
    "Orange 'Buy Now' button at the bottom right of the page"
  ]
}
```

Now, please analyze the screenshot I upload and return the data in a valid JSON format.

page_exist_prompt = f'''You are a UI analysis expert specializing in structural interface comparison. Your task is to determine if a **"New Screenshot"** is structurally distinct from a set of provided **"Existing Pages."** The primary determinant for a new structure is the addition, removal, or significant rearrangement of interactive elements.

## Core Principle

Your analysis must focus on the screen's interactive blueprint—the set and layout of available user controls. Interfaces are considered structurally identical if they present the same set of controls in a similar arrangement, even if the data displayed within those controls is different.

## Decision Criteria

### Conditions for an Identical Interface (Match)

Consider the new screenshot a match to an existing page if:

  * The set of all interactive controls (buttons, tabs, input fields, list items, etc.) and their overall layout are identical.
  * Differences are confined to dynamic data or content, such as text in labels, user-specific information (names, avatars), or the specific items within a scrollable list.

### Conditions for a New Interface (Mismatch)

Consider the new screenshot to be a new interface if any of the following structural changes are observed:

  * **Addition or Removal of Controls**: The new screen contains interactive elements (buttons, links, icons) that are not present on the existing page, or vice-versa.
  * **Change in Core Navigation**: The structure of a primary navigation element (e.g., top navigation bar, bottom tab bar) has been altered in its items, icons, or order.
  * **Change in Global State**: A global state change has occurred, such as the appearance or disappearance of a keyboard, a system pop-up, or a modal dialog, as this fundamentally alters the set of available user interactions.


## Input & Output

You will receive one "New Screenshot" and one or more "Existing Pages" for comparison.

Your response **MUST** be a single JSON object with no other text or explanations.

  * If a structural match is found, set `is_new` to `false` and provide the `index` of the first matching page.
  * If no match is found, set `is_new` to `true` and `existing_index` to `-1`.

```json
{{
  "is_new": <true_or_false>,
  "existing_index": <index_of_match_or_-1>
}}
```

next_operation_prompt = '''You are a professional app testing expert. Your objective is exploratory testing: discover and cover as many new pages as possible. 
Only consider operations that can trigger a page transition. Ignore controls such as toggles, switches, play/pause, or close buttons that do not lead to a new page.

## Exploration Context

### 1. Local Exploration Map
This map shows the current page, its immediate neighbors, and the operations attempted from the current page with their target pages. Use it to avoid immediate loops.
{exploration_map_str}

### 2. Recent Instruction History (Strategic Level)
Last 3 high-level instructions you executed:
{instruction_history_str}

### 3. Recent Action History (Operational Level)
Chronological list of the last 5 specific operations and 6 screenshots showing the flow:
1. screen before first operation
2-6. screens after each operation
The last screenshot is the current screen. Use these to infer UI state changes.
{history_str}

### 4. Current State & Feedback
You are on Page {curr_page_index}. The last image is this page.
Operations already attempted from this page:
{explored_ops_str}
{feedback_prompt_section}

## Task
Analyze all the context provided and choose the next most strategic action that is likely to lead to a new page or state.
The action can be a single step or a multi-step sequence.

### Decision Principles
There is no fixed priority order; use your expertise to justify your choice internally.

1. Core Rule:
- No Redundancy: Do not repeat any operation already listed under "attempted operations" for this page. Avoid near-duplicates that likely produce the same outcome.

2. Strategy Options (pick one, only for page-transition actions):
- Explore Broadly: navigate to a new, unexplored page if a clear path exists.
- Explore Deeply: interact with unexplored page-transition features on the current page (e.g., tabs, links, navigation buttons).
- Complete Workflows: progress a multi-step task (login, registration, checkout) that involves moving between pages.

3. Efficiency Tactics (use when appropriate, only for page-transition actions):
- Multi-Step Sampling: For pages with multiple lists, grids, or sections, issue one multi-step command to sample items across sections.
- Batch Input: If the page has multiple input fields that together lead to a new page, issue one command to fill them all and submit.

4. Special Rule for Bottom Navigation:
- If the page contains a bottom navigation bar with multiple tabs, prioritize fully exploring the content of the **current active tab** first.
- After exhausting the current tab, explore the other tabs one by one.

## Output
Your response must be a single line of text containing only the command to be executed.
Do not add any explanations, labels, or formatting like JSON or markdown. Just the raw command string.

### Single-Step Example
Click 'System Settings' icon

### Multi-Step Example
Click first item in 'Recommended for You', press device back, click first item in 'Top Charts'

Now, analyze the context and return only the single-line command string.

verify_operation_prompt = '''You are a meticulous automated test analyst. Your task is to analyze a sequence of screenshots and operations to find **ALL critical failures** in a user flow. You must check each step chronologically and compile a list of every step that failed.

### Input Information
You will be given a sequence of images and actions formatted as follows:
- `Initial State (Screenshot 0)`: The screen before any action is taken.
- `Step 1 Operation`: The first operation.
- `Post-Operation State (Screenshot 1)`: The screen after the 1st operation.
- `Step 2 Operation`: The second operation.
- `Post-Operation State (Screenshot 2)`: The screen after the 2nd operation.
- ...and so on.

### Core Analysis Directives
Your task is to analyze this entire sequence **step-by-step from beginning to end**. For each step `i` (from 1 to N):
1. **Compare `Screenshot (i-1)` with `Screenshot i`**.
2. **Evaluate whether the change is the logical and expected result of `Step i Operation`**.
3. **You must analyze EVERY step**. Even if you find a failure, continue analyzing subsequent steps to find all possible failures in the sequence.
4. **Compile a list of ALL steps** that resulted in a "Critical Failure".

#### Definition of "Critical Failure":
(This definition applies to each individual step)
A. **Process Blocker**
   - **App Crash or Blank Screen**: The app crashes, or the screen becomes blank/unresponsive.
   - **Unrecoverable Obstruction**: A blocking pop-up (ad, error) appears and prevents progress.
   - **Infinite Loading**: The screen gets stuck in a loading state.

B. **Core Function Failure**
   - **Clear Logical Contradiction**: The operation's main purpose fails (e.g., after "Add to Cart," the cart is still empty; after "Delete," the item remains).
   - **Critical Navigation Failure**: Clicking a navigation element leads to a crash, a wrong page, or no change.

---

### Output Format
You must return your analysis strictly in the following JSON format, containing **only two keys**: `status` and `feedback`.

```json
{
  "status": "<'success' or 'error'>",
  "feedback": "<detailed_feedback_string>"
}
````

**Output Field Explanations:**

* `status`:

  * `"success"`: If **ALL** steps in the sequence were executed without any "Critical Failure".
  * `"error"`: If you detected one or more "Critical Failures".

* `feedback`: The content of this string **depends on the `status`**.

  * **If `status` is `"success"`**: The feedback must be a **concise, high-level summary of the entire operation sequence's goal and successful outcome.**
  * **If `status` is `"error"`**: The feedback **MUST detail each critical failure found**. For each failure, you must describe the context (from which screen/step to which screen/step) and what error occurred. Combine all failures into a single descriptive string.

### Example 1: Successful Sequence

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "feedback": "The operation sequence successfully executed selecting a product from the product list page and adding it to the shopping cart."
}
```

### Example 2: Sequence with a Single Failure

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "feedback": "An error occurred at Step 2: After attempting the 'Click “Add to Cart” button' operation from the product details page, the screen did not change, and the cart quantity did not increase."
}
```

### Example 3: Sequence with Multiple Failures

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "feedback": "Multiple defects detected:\n1. At Step 2, after performing the 'Click “Filter” button' operation on the product list page, the page did not respond.\n2. At Step 4, after performing 'Click “Buy Now”' on the details page, the app crashed."
}
